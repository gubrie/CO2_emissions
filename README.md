Global CO₂ Emissions Analysis

This project is an interactive Power BI report analyzing global CO₂ emissions by country, continent, and emission category. The dashboard provides both a global overview and country-level comparisons, helping to identify emission trends, key contributors, and sector-level insights.

🎯 Project Goal

The goal of this project is to provide a comprehensive overview of global CO₂ emissions and support sustainability efforts by visualizing historical trends, the main emitting countries, and the role of different energy sources. The dashboard helps decision-makers, researchers, and stakeholders quickly and transparently understand where emissions come from and which sources contribute the most to environmental impact.

❓ Key Questions Addressed in the Report

How have global CO₂ emissions evolved over the past decades (1960–2022)?

Which countries and regions are responsible for the largest share of emissions?

Which energy sources (oil, coal, gas, cement, flaring) contribute most to emissions globally and by country?

How do national emission structures differ?

What is the share of each country in global emissions?

What trends can be observed among the top emitters – are emissions increasing or decreasing in recent years?
